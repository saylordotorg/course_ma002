Precalculus I is designed to prepare you for Precalculus II, Calculus,
Physics, and higher math and science courses. In this course, the main
focus is on five types of functions: linear, polynomial, rational,
exponential, and logarithmic. In accompaniment with these functions, you
will learn how to solve equations and inequalities, graph, find domains
and ranges, combine functions, and solve a multitude of real-world
applications. In this course, you will not only be learning new
algebraic techniques that are necessary for other math and science
courses, but you will be learning to become a critical thinker. You will
be able to determine what is the best approach to take such as
numerical, graphical, or algebraic to solve a problem given particular
information. Then you will investigate and solve the problem, interpret
the answer, and determine if it is reasonable. A few examples of
applications in this course are determining compound interest, growth of
bacteria, decay of a radioactive substance, and the maximum height of a
rocket. You will also use a graphing calculator to model a data set and
find the function of best-fit and then interpolate or extrapolate from
that function. This course has been developed through a partnership with
the Washington State Board for Community & Technical Colleges. Unless

### Learning Outcomes

Upon successful completion of this course, you will be able to:  

-   define the concept of function and determine the domain, range,
    inverse, and symmetries of functions;
-   graph linear, absolute value, root, piecewise, polynomial, rational,
    exponential, and logarithmic functions and circles;
-   identify the properties of polynomial and rational functions such as
    degree, maximum number of zeros, maximum number of turns,
    multiplicity of zeros, vertical asymptotes, horizontal asymptotes,
    and long-run behavior;
-   compute the equations of linear, polynomial, rational, exponential,
    and logarithmic functions analytically given appropriate data;
-   estimate solutions to and solve equations involving linear, absolute
    value, root, polynomial, rational, exponential, and logarithmic
    functions;
-   solve inequalities involving linear, absolute value, and polynomial
    functions;
-   utilize multiple approaches to describe functions such as verbally,
    algebraically, in tabular form, or graphically;
-   solve and analyze application problems such as optimization or
    growth/decay, using the appropriate functions, and evaluate the
    reasonableness of the solution; and
-   utilize technology to model linear, polynomial, exponential, and
    logarithmic data and interpret the results.

### Course Information

Welcome to MA002: Precalculus I. Below, please find some general
information on the course and its requirements.  
  
 **Course Designer:** Pamela Maslyk and [Professor Abby
Sharp](http://www.saylor.org/faculty-o-t/#ProfessorAbbySharp)  
    
 **Primary Resources:** This course is comprised of a range of different
free, online materials. However, the course makes primary use of the
following materials (Important: Please take the time to make sure that
the resources below will run appropriately on your computer):

-   David Lippman and Melonie Rasmussen’s [*Precalculus: An
    Investigation of
    Functions*](http://www.opentextbookstore.com/precalc/1.1/Precalc.pdf) (PDF)
-   Khan Academy’s “Precalculus” videos (YouTube)
-   Mathispower4u videos (YouTube)

**Requirements for Completion:** In order to complete this course, you
will need to work through each unit and all of its assigned materials.
You will need to complete the following:

-   Unit 1 Activities
-   Unit 1 Assessment
-   Unit 2 Activities
-   Unit 2 Assessment
-   Unit 3 Activities
-   Unit 3 Assessment
-   Unit 4 Activities
-   Unit 4 Assessment
-   Final Exam

Note that you will only receive an official grade on your final exam.
However, in order to adequately prepare for this exam, you will need to
work through the activities and assessments for each unit.  
    
 In order to “pass” this course, you will need to earn a 70% or higher
on the final exam. Your score on the exam will be tabulated as soon as
you complete it. If you do not pass the exam, you may take it again.  
    
 **Time Commitment**: This course should take approximately **93 hours**
to complete. Each unit includes a time advisory that lists the amount
of time you are expected to spend on each subunit. It may be helpful for
you to review these time advisories in advance in order to budget your
time wisely.  
    
 **Tips/Suggestions**: Please make sure to take comprehensive notes as
you go through each section. Label your work clearly so you can recall
it easily. It may be a good idea to review the homework problems before
each new unit, as the new material often builds on the previous unit. If
there is anything you have forgotten, you can go back and review the
material in that particular subunit to refresh your memory. In addition
to the reviews at the end of each unit, go back through your notes to
recall what you have learned before taking the final exam.
