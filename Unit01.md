**Unit 1: Functions** <span id="1"></span> 
*Computing postage for a package, the gasoline consumption when driving
at 65 mph, or how much money will be in a savings account after five
years are all examples of where functions are utilized. Functions are
used to model everyday relationships between two quantities and this
unit will be your introduction to this concept using words, tables,
equations, and graphs.*  
    
 *Unit 1 will begin with defining the concept of function, domain,
range, function notation, and how to evaluate and graph a basic group of
functions called “toolkit functions.” You also will explore the
behaviors of functions including rate of change, local extrema, and
concavity. The remainder of the unit builds from combining functions
using composition and transformations and ends with finding a function’s
inverse. All of these skills will be used throughout the remaining
units.*

**Unit 1 Time Advisory**

**Unit1 Learning Outcomes**  
Upon successful completion of this unit, you will be able to:

-   evaluate a function and an average rate of change;
-   graph the toolkit functions;
-   evaluate the domain and range of toolkit functions in interval and
    set builder notation;
-   identify where a function is increasing, decreasing, concave up or
    down, and has local extrema and inflections points;
-   compose two functions from equations, graphs, or tables;
-   perform transformations (shifts, compressions/stretches, and
    reflections) of toolkit functions;
-   identify the symmetry of a function;
-   compute and interpret inverse functions from a chart, graph, or
    function; and
-   utilize a graphing calculator to graph a function in an appropriate
    window.
