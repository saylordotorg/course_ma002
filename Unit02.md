**Unit 2: Linear Functions** <span id="2"></span> 
*Is there a relationship between the number of hours of TV a person
watches and the number of sit-ups that person can do? Exploring data and
determining if a pattern exists is an important part of mathematical
modeling. If a relationship is found, it can be used to predict current
and future behaviors of the variables.*  
    
 *In this unit, the relationship of variables with a constant rate of
change is explored. Linear functions are used widely in applications of
mathematics and your study will begin with the slope of a line,
computing linear equations based on various forms of data and how to
graph using both analytic methods and technology. Further exploration of
data and technology are learned by using least-square regression on data
sets to determine if a linear relationship exists and the strength of
the trend. Other relationships will be explored in future units as the
data sets become more complex. *

**Unit 2 Time Advisory**  
This unit should take approximately 20.75 hours to complete.
