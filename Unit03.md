**Unit 3: Polynomial and Rational Functions** <span id="3"></span> 
*Linear functions are used to measure many situations, but curved
situations such as the path of a baseball hit into the air or
concentrations and dilutions of solutions will need polynomial and
rational functions investigated in this unit. Local extrema, intercepts,
and asymptotes will help to interpret the behavior of these situations
and make extrapolations.*  
    
 *Unit 3 begins with the study of polynomials and their behaviors and
then concentrates on quadratic functions, equations, and applications.
Your function toolkit will be expanded to include rational and root
functions that include new challenges when graphing and solving for
domains, inverses, and long-term behavior. These new techniques will be
important in higher level courses in mathematics such as calculus.*

**Unit 3 Time Advisory**  
This unit should take approximately 18.25 hours to complete.
