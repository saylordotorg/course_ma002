title: "MA002: Precalculus I"
course_description: "Precalculus I is designed to prepare you for Precalculus II, Calculus, Physics, and higher math and science courses. In this course, the main focus is on five types of functions: linear, polynomial, rational, exponential, and logarithmic. In accompaniment with these functions, you will learn how to solve equations and inequalities, graph, find domains and ranges, combine functions, and solve a multitude of real-world applications."

**Unit 4: Exponential and Logarithmic Functions** <span id="4"></span> 
*Imagine that a patient is given 3 mg of a medication after an
operation. How long before the level of medication reduces to ½ mg? Is
the medication ever truly gone out of the patient’s system? The previous
functions studied have entailed a variable raised to a numeric power.
This unit will introduce two new functional types which reverse this
relationship and investigate a number raised to a variable power. These
exponential and logarithmic functions are amazing tools for analyzing
many real-world situations.*  
    
 *This last unit will introduce exponential functions and their inverse
functions, logarithms. You will explore the graphs, domains and ranges,
and applications of these functions. Once logarithms and their
properties are learned, you will be able to solve exponential and
logarithmic equations which are needed to analyze situations such as
population growth, radioactive decay, acidity, investments, and logistic
growth. Furthermore, you will investigate technology with regression
activities involving linearizing exponential functions which is used in
statistical analysis. *
